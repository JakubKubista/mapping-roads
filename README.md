#### Goal of the project
The user can start capturing his position, and this information is stored into the database. If a user completes the measurement of the route, then he have to write additional information about his journey (e. g. transportation or terrain). Saved journeys can then be exported to a format such. GeoJSON, KML, or other common format.
